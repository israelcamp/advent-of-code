# Advent of Code

I will try to add here the solutions to the problems of Advent of Code.

I hereby declare that I will not use any external libraries to solve the problems, except for the standard library.
I will also not use any external resources, such as Stack Overflow or other forums, to find solutions to the problems.
I will not use any AI tools to generate code or solutions for the problems.

## 2024 âœ…

- Days done: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25

*AOC 2024 COMPLETED!*

Maybe I will go back to previous years and solve them too, but not for now.

## 2023

I have decided that I will do challenges from 2023 from time to time.
I will do them in other language than Python, probably Lua.

- Days done: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

I confess I used GPT-o4-mini-high to solve day 5 part 2, part 1 was done all by myself, but I wanted to see how far I could go with the AI, could it solve AOC problems?,
